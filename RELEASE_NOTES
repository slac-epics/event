(RELEASE_NOTES) lists changes for ALL directories.

event-R2-4-3: Aug 8, 2007
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01evr.substitutions - use
	  beam/10hz for PH1 (PCAV) instead of klys accelerate.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01trig.substitutions - correct
	  event code name for each trigger.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-MP01evr.substitutions - add trigger
	  for shutter.
	* evrSupport/Db/evr/evrPMXX.substitutions - trigger profile monitors
	  using 10hz-all-the-time event code (43).
	* evrSupport/Db/evr/evrEventAll.substitutions - change LCLSTBD4 to
	  LCACC_10 (klystron accel at 10hz max).
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01bsa.substitutions - correct GUN
	  and PCAV inputs.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-LI21-RF01bsa.substitutions - correct PCAV
	  input.
event-R2-4-2: Aug 2, 2007
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01bsa.substitutions - correct typo
	  ACCL:IN20:400:L0B_P* BSA pvs.
	* evrSupport/Db/bsa/bsaBLENEdef.substitutions to correct the name 
	  of the BLEN BSA pv attributes.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01evr.substitutions - use 10hz
	  event codes (43 and 154) for most LLRF PADs since the LLRF system
	  cannot handle 30hz triggers.
event-R2-4-1: July 16, 2007
	* Use generalTime-R1-2-0.
event-R2-4-0: July 02, 2007
	* Moved drvSupport files to evrSupport and MpgApp and removed
	  drvSupport from Makefile.  libdrvSupport no longer exists.
	  Correct README file.
	* Moved test evr images and databases from evrSupport to new
	  directory, evrIoc.  evrIoc created but left commented out of
	  production event/Makefile - it is only built for development
	  purposes.
	* Correct configure/RELEASE for R1-0-0 of miscUtils and
	  sSubRecord.
	* evrSupport/src/drvEvr.c - make sure pattern and fiducial are 
	  processed in the correct order if both are ready at the same time.
	* evrSupport/Db/bsa/bsaPHASEdef.substitutions - fix typo.
	* evrSupport/Db/bsa/bsaBLENEdef.substitutions - changed WIDTH to 
	  (ATB)_ZRAW, where ATB can be A-E
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-LI21-BL01trig.substitutions - correct trigger
	  order.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-LI21-BL01bsa.substitutions - added ATB macro 
	  for use with new bsaBLENEdef pv names.
	* Add this file.
	* mrfApp/src/mrfVme64x.* - add check for VME EVR 230 if EVR 200 is not 
	  found.
	* mrfApp/src/erRecord.c - dorrect monitor logic for the taxi field 
	  (loss of receiver).
	* mrfApp/src/devMrfEr.c - remove rxvc field support.  It is replaced 
	  by the taxi field.  Remove ERROR_LOST_PLL logic - this bit no longer 
	  exists in the CSR (for EVR 200 and up).
	* mrfApp/src/drvMrfEr.* - remove EVR_CSR_PLL_LOST bit - it's no longer 
	  supported in the CSR.  Remove ErCheckPhaseLock.
	  Correct logic to allow VME and PMC EVRs on the same IOC.
	  And new registers to the register map for the VME EVR 230.  
	  Support for these registers will come in another release.
