	  interrupt.  Don't set evrTask event in the fiducial interrupt until 
	  task is ready.  Set timeout flag in evrTask timeout logic.
	* evrSupport/src/evrMessage.c,.h - don't write a buffer if it's being
	  read (throw it away).  Timeout logic added to read routine.  Remove
	  unnecessary mutex locking (everything done in same task). Changes
	  to diagnostic counters.  Add routines to set timeout flag and
	  update missing fiducial counter.
	* evrSupport/src/evrTime.c - set all timestamps in pipeline to bad
	  when 3 same pulses.  Changes to diagnostic counters.
	* evrSupport/src/evrPattern.c,.h - add timeout error processing.  
	  Changes to diagnostic counters.  Don't set timestamp to bad until
	  3 bad pulses in a row unless there is a timeout error. 
	* evrSupport/src/bsa.c - use INPD instead of SDIS for timestamp check.
	* evrSupport/Db/bsa/bsaEdefAvg.db, bsaEdefFanouts.db - add GO bi

	  space cannot be set up or the IRQ level cannot be set.  Process
	  data before events in the ISR.
	* mrfApp/src/os/RTEMS/vmeCSRMemProbeB.c - probe 2 or 4 bytes depending

	  counter and skip pulse instead.  Add check for invalid message size 
	  in data interrupt.  Set timeout flag before processing data in 
	  fiducial timeout logic of the evrTask (for the case where fiducials
	  are missing but data is still being received - throw data away).
	* evrSupport/src/evrMessage.c,.h - remove unnecessary mutex lock.
	  Change logic so that the write routine at interrupt throws away data 
	  if the buffer it wants to write to is being read by the evrTask.  
	  Add routine for evrTask to set timeout flag and the read routine 
	  to reset it and return timeout error.  Add routine for fiducial 
	  interrupt to call to update the missing fiducial counter.

event-R2-4-7:
Built against EPICS R3.14.8.2 and RTEMS 4.7.1


event-R2-4-6: Aug 31, 2007
	* evrSupport/Db/evr/evrEvent.db, evrEventAll.substitutions:
	  - Use PRIO macro to set the priority of the event RATE record so 
	    that FIDUCIALRATE can be processed at a higher priority and won't 
	    have to wait for other high priority tasks (like on the prof mon 
	    iocs).  FIDUCIALRATE uses a counter which updates at 360Hz and 
	    needs to process within 2.7msec of the updating event.  
	  - Add alarm limits to RATE so that FIDUCIALRATE can be alarmed when 
	    it isn't exactly 360Hz.
	  - Add NAME record for a longer, more descriptive name associated
	    with the event.
	* mrfApp/src/drvMrfEr.c - remove kluge added in previous version.
	  Correct the order of the FIFO register reads instead.
event-R2-4-5: Aug 21, 2007
	* README - Add instructions for channel watcher and archiver.
	  Add instructions for setting the TSE fields for trigger devices 
	  that take time to process.  Correct checkout instructions.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01bsa.substitutions - correct laser 
	  inputs, uncomment PCAV:IN20:365 amplitude. 
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01evr.substitutions,
	  IOC-IN20-RF01trig.substitutions - Move scope 1 trigger to 
	  TS 3, 30Hz (event code 32). 
	* evrIoc/Db - Corrections for test stands.
	* evrSupport/src/evrTime.*, evrPattern.c - support timestamp per 
	  event code.  The TSE field of records can now be set to an
	  event code so that the record's timestamp is now the time of the 
	  event code instead of the time of the last fiducial.
	* evrSupport/src/evrModifier.c - evrPattern subroutine now gets
	  current time from the pipeline table when TSE is -2.  This time
	  updates at 360hz and is needed by MPS.  
	* evrSupport/Db/evr/evrEvent.db - the priority and processing order
	  of the event code records, which process every time an event code 
	  IRQ goes off, are set to high so that these records processes ASAP
	  after the IRQ.  These records now update the event code timestamp 
	  which needs to be done before records that use TSE are processed.
	* evrSupport/Db/evr/evrPattern.db, evrPatternAll.substitutions,
	  evrFiducial.db - add PATTERN360HZ for 360hz pattern update needed 
	  by MPS (PATTERN only updates at 120hz).  Make PATTERN records 
	  forward link to the next one to avoid having another fanout.
	  Set TSE to -2 for PATTERN360HZ to get the current pipeline time.
	  Get rid of MOD720 fanout in place of FLNKs.
	* mrfApp/src/drvMrfEr.c - add kluge in interrupt handler for VME EVR.
          When the event FIFO is read at interrupt level, the first event
	  has to be thrown away (it's the same as the last event read the
	  last time the fifo was processed) and an extra read has to be done
	  after the FIFO is "empty".  Hopefully, this kluge can be removed
	  when the event FIFO is read at task level - otherwise, this is a
	  firmware bug and the kluge remains until the firmware is fixed.
event-R2-4-4: Aug 10, 2007
    * evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-LI21-BL01pattern.substitution - change
      TS1ST = 0 from 1 to give BLEN more time after trigger
event-R2-4-3: Aug 8, 2007
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01evr.substitutions - use
	  beam/10hz for PH1 (PCAV) instead of klys accelerate.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01trig.substitutions - correct
	  event code name for each trigger.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-MP01evr.substitutions - add trigger
	  for shutter.
	* evrSupport/Db/evr/evrEventAll.substitutions - change LCLSTBD4 to
	  LCACC_10 (klystron accel at 10hz max).
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01bsa.substitutions - correct GUN
	  inputs.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-LI21-RF01bsa.substitutions - correct PCAV
	  input.
event-R2-4-2: Aug 2, 2007
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01bsa.substitutions - correct typo
	  ACCL:IN20:400:L0B_P* BSA pvs.
	* evrSupport/Db/bsa/bsaBLENEdef.substitutions to correct the name 
	  of the BLEN BSA pv attributes.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-IN20-RF01evr.substitutions - use 10hz
	  event codes (43 and 154) for most LLRF PADs since the LLRF system
	  cannot handle 30hz triggers.
event-R2-4-1: July 16, 2007
	* Use generalTime-R1-2-0.
event-R2-4-0: July 02, 2007
	* Moved drvSupport files to evrSupport and MpgApp and removed
	  drvSupport from Makefile.  libdrvSupport no longer exists.
	  Correct README file.
	* Moved test evr images and databases from evrSupport to new
	  directory, evrIoc.  evrIoc created but left commented out of
	  production event/Makefile - it is only built for development
	  purposes.
	* Correct configure/RELEASE for R1-0-0 of miscUtils and
	  sSubRecord.
	* evrSupport/src/drvEvr.c - make sure pattern and fiducial are 
	  processed in the correct order if both are ready at the same time.
	* evrSupport/Db/bsa/bsaPHASEdef.substitutions - fix typo.
	* evrSupport/Db/bsa/bsaBLENEdef.substitutions - changed WIDTH to 
	  (ATB)_ZRAW, where ATB can be A-E
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-LI21-BL01trig.substitutions - correct trigger
	  order.
	* evrSupport/Db/ioc/IOC-LI21-BL01bsa.substitutions - added ATB macro 
	  for use with new bsaBLENEdef pv names.
	* Add this file.
	* mrfApp/src/mrfVme64x.* - add check for VME EVR 230 if EVR 200 is not 
	  found.
	* mrfApp/src/erRecord.c - dorrect monitor logic for the taxi field 
	  (loss of receiver).
	* mrfApp/src/devMrfEr.c - remove rxvc field support.  It is replaced 
	  by the taxi field.  Remove ERROR_LOST_PLL logic - this bit no longer 
	  exists in the CSR (for EVR 200 and up).
	* mrfApp/src/drvMrfEr.* - remove EVR_CSR_PLL_LOST bit - it's no longer 
	  supported in the CSR.  Remove ErCheckPhaseLock.
	  Correct logic to allow VME and PMC EVRs on the same IOC.
	  And new registers to the register map for the VME EVR 230.  
	  Support for these registers will come in another release.
