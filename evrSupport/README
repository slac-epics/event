This directory contains all the EPICS databases and subroutines
for the EVR iocs that are OSI. This area  builds a library 
that contains lcls beam-synchronous acquisition (bsa) as well as 
all evr support (pattern pipelineing, etc). 
It creates libevrSupport and installs dbd and db files.

evrSupport library (<INSTALL_LOCATION>/lib/<arch>/libevrSupport.a) contents:
libsrc: functions for subroutine records

Also in this directory:
Db:     bsa databases - 
        bsa<*>Test.db and .templates are for device simulators. Load for 
	      test data.
TBD  edm:    bsa low-level displays
 
micro/saIoc is an application which currently assembles all libraries needed
for the slc-aware BSAC IOC and EVR support, creates a database 
definition file with all components (saIoc.dbd), and builds a test slc-aware 
IOC application.  Rebuild that area after any change to evrSupport/src.
