--------------------------------

I - Adding the event package to your IOC application:
-----------------------------------------------------

(1) Add EVENT, GENERALTIME, and SSUBRECORD to configure/RELEASE and 
clean/rebuild configure:

EVENT=/afs/slac/g/lcls/epics/site/src/event
GENERALTIME=/afs/slac/g/lcls/epics/site/src/generalTime
SSUBRECORD=/afs/slac/g/lcls/epics/site
 OR 
include $(TOP)/../site/configure/RELEASE-event
include $(TOP)/../site/configure/RELEASE-generalTime
SSUBRECORD=$(TOP)/../site

(2) Link event libraries into your app by adding to xxxApp/src/Makefile:

   xxx_LIBS += evrSupport
   xxx_LIBS += drvSupport
   xxx_LIBS += sSubRecord
   xxx_LIBS += generalTime
   xxx_LIBS += devMrfEr
   xxx_LIBS += mrfVme64x
 OR (if including /afs/slac/g/lcls/epics/site/configure/RELEASE-event in
     your xxxApp/configure/RELEASE):
   xxx_LIBS += $(EVR_IOC_LIBS)
   xxx_LIBS += $(EVR_RTEMS_IOC_LIBS)

Note that the order of the above libraries is important.

(3) Add the following .dbd files to xxxApp/src/Makefile 
    or to xxxApp/src/xxxInclude.dbd:

   xxx_DBD += evrSupport.dbd
   xxx_DBD += devMrfEr.dbd

(4) Install the following applicable ioc-specific database 
    files from the event package to your application by adding to 
    xxxApp/Db/Makefile:

   DB_INSTALLS += $(EVENT)/db/IOC-<area>-<xxyy>evr.db
   DB_INSTALLS += $(EVENT)/db/IOC-<area>-<xxyy>pattern.db
   And for IOCs that support beam-synchronous acquisition:
   DB_INSTALLS += $(EVENT)/db/IOC-<area>-<xxyy>bsa.db

   where area = LR20, IN20, LI21, etc
   and   xx = subsystem ID (AM, BL, BP, IM, LS, MG, MP, PM, RF, WS)
         yy = unique number per area and subSystem ID (01, 02, 03, etc)

II - Adding event databases and EVR configuration to your IOC startup file:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Add database templates to st.cmd (before iocInit): 

   dbLoadRecords("db/IOC-<area>-<xxyy>evr.db")
   dbLoadRecords("db/IOC-<area>-<xxyy>pattern.db")
   And for IOCs that support beam-synchronous acquisition:
   dbLoadRecords("db/IOC-<area>-<xxyy>bsa.db")

(2) Add ErConfigure for each VME EVR (before iocInit).  For the first VME card:

    ErConfigure(<z>,0x300000,0x60,4,0)

    where z        = physical slot number in the VME crate, counting from 1
    and   0x300000 = card address for card 1, 
                     increment by 0x100000 for each subsequent card
    and   0x60     = interrupt vector for card 1, 
                     increment by  0x02 for each subsequent card
    and   4        = interrupt level (can be the same for all VME EVRs)
    and   0        = VME

(3) Add ErConfigure for each PMC EVR (before iocInit):

    ErConfigure(<z>,0,0,0,1)
    where z = 0 for first PMC instance, 1 for second PMC instance
    and   0 = card address     (not used)
    and   0 = interrupt vector (not used)
    and   0 = interrupt level  (not used)
    and   1 = PMC

III - Hardware Setup:
---------------------

(1) Installation instructions for the PMC EVR are here:
    http://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/lcls/controls/global/subsystems/timing/PMC-EVR_install_inst_v1d0.pdf

(2) Connect fiber from a nearby timing fiber fanout module to each EVR.  These 
    fanout modules are identified in the timing system block diagram by 
    Mike Browne:
