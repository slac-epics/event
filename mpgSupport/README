This directory contains all the EPICS databases and sequences
for the EVG event definitions (EDEF) that are OSI. This area  builds a 
library libmpgSupport and installs dbd and db files.

 
epics/ioc/edefSimApp is an OSI test application which currently assembles all
libraries needed for slc-aware BSAC IOC and EVR support, creates a database 
definition file with all components (edef.dbd), and builds a test slc-aware 
IOC application.  Rebuild that area after any change to edef/src. edefSimApp 
loads records that simulate device data.
